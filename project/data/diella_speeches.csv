Albania’s AI ‘minister’ makes its debut with an address to parliament
TIRANA, Albania (AP) — An AI-generated government “minister” made its debut with an address in the Albanian parliament on Thursday, with Prime Minister Edi Rama presenting the bot as a symbol of his government’s push for transparency and innovation.
The government said the bot — named Diella, which means sun in Albanian, and depicted as a woman in traditional Albanian dress — will help tackle corruption in public spending. But opposition lawmakers were highly critical, and believe the program is a way for the government to hide graft.
“The Constitution speaks of institutions at the people’s service. It doesn’t speak of chromosomes, of flesh or blood,” the avatar declared in a three-minute address delivered from two large screens. “It speaks of duties, accountability, transparency, non-discriminatory service.”
“I assure you that I embody such values as strictly as every human colleague, maybe even more,” added the artificial persona.
Rama argued that the AI-generated bot will help the government work faster and with full transparency. It is one element in a larger plan to highlight the Balkan nation’s technological innovations as it works toward European Union membership. Albania hopes to join the 27-member bloc by 2030.
Opposition lawmakers banged their hands on their tables, pushing the speaker to cut short the debate on the government program. The session ended after 25 minutes.
They also boycotted a vote on the Cabinet’s program, but it passed anyway with 82 votes in favor in the 140-seat parliament. The opposition did not explain how it believed the government would exploit Diella to hide corruption in public finances.
Democrats asked for a repeat of the parliamentary session, complaining that the governing Socialists canceled the debate on the Cabinet’s program.
Diella was created earlier this year in cooperation with Microsoft as a virtual assistant on the e-Albania public service platform. It has helped users navigate the site and get access to about 1 million digital inquiries and documents.
“I am not here to replace people but to help them,” the bot said in its address to parliament. “True I have no citizenship, but I have no personal ambition or interests either.”","albania, address, parliament, bot, program, debut, albanian, transparency",https://apnews.com/article/albania-new-cabinet-program-ai-minister-diella-corruption-3aa58c801d69b5b295975cc68079a2d3,Albania's AI ‘minister’ makes its debut with an address to parliament
2025-09-19,"The world's first AI government minister was appointed last week by Albania's prime minister to oversee decisions on public tenders and make them ""100 per cent corruption-free"".
On Thursday, Diella — as it is known — gave its inaugural address to Albania's parliament on Thursday, local time.
Amid concerns its appointment was unconstitutional, Diella vowed it was ""not here to replace people, but to help them"".
A new artificially-generated minister has given its inaugural address to Albania's parliament, defending its role as ""not here to replace people, but to help them"".
The world's first AI government minister was appointed last week by Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama.
""Some have called me 'unconstitutional' because I am not a human being,"" the AI — dubbed Diella, or ""sun"" in Albanian — told parliament in a video, appearing as a woman dressed in a traditional Albanian costume.
It was unclear how the video was generated or the origin of the speech.
""Let me remind you, the real danger to constitutions has never been the machines but the inhumane decisions of those in power,"" the bot said.
Last week Mr Rama said the AI would be entrusted with all decisions on public tenders, making them ""100 per cent corruption-free and every public fund submitted to the tender procedure will be perfectly transparent"".
Diella was launched in January as an AI-powered virtual assistant to help people use the official e-Albania platform, which provides documents and services.
Albania ranks 80th out of 180 countries in Transparency International's corruption index.
The mayor of the capital Tirana, a former close associate of Mr Rama, has been in pre-trial detention for months on suspicion of corruption in the awarding of public contracts and money laundering.
But the AI minister has angered the opposition.
""The goal is nothing more than to attract attention,"" former prime minister and opposition leader Sali Berisha said, who has himself been accused of graft.
""It is impossible to curb corruption with Diella,"" he added.
""Who will control Diella? Diella is unconstitutional, and the Democratic Party will take the matter to the Constitutional Court,"" he said.
The government's plans were adopted after a rowdy debate in which the opposition boycotted the vote.
The AI also responded to constitutional concerns, noting that the law ""speaks of duties, responsibilities, transparency, without discrimination.""
""I assure you, I embody these values as rigorously as any human colleague. Perhaps even more so.""
The fight against corruption is key to Albania's bid to join the European Union.
Mr Rama aspires to lead the Balkan nation of 2.8 million people into the bloc by 2030.","diella, corruption, albania's, has, public, people, rama, said",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-19/ai-generated-minister-addresses-albanian-parliament/105791708,AI-generated minister addresses Albanian parliament for first time
